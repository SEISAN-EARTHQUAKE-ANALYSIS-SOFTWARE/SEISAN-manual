The programs by \textbf{Robert Herrmann} (Herrmann, 1996) to estimate the shear 
wave velocity of the earth by inversion of surface wave
\index{Surface wave analysis} 
group velocities
\index{inversion of surface wave group velocities} 
are distributed with Seisan. The programs are part of Herrmann's package
\index{Herrmann's package} 
``\textit{Computer Programs in Seismology}''. For more information check:

The programs have been implemented with SEISAN by Vunganai Midzi, who has written a guide on how to use the programs. This document is given as the Word file `surface.doc' in the INF directory. Also see section \ref{subs:spec} for details on output files that can be generated with MULPLT. The programs are included in the tar file `surface.tar' in the PRO directory, but are not installed as part of the standard installation. If you wish to use the programs, you need to extract the programs: 

\begin{verbatim}
cd <SEISAN_TOP>/PRO
tar xvf surface.tar 
\end{verbatim}

You can recompile the programs with the commands: 

\begin{verbatim}
make -f Makefile.sur clean
make -f Makefile.sur 
\end{verbatim}
