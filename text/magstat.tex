\label{MAGSTAT}

The program MAGSTAT can be used with MAG2 to produce statistics that 
allow to evaluate the magnitude scale. 
As input it takes a STATION file, as produced by MAG2, and a Nordic 
input file. Here, one can use any data set, 
or the events that were used in the MAG2 inversion.

This program is still under construction.
