An example of a plot is shown in Figure 46. The program supports 1-char subclass names only.

The following output files are created:

volcstat.batch - c-shell script to generate Postscript output using GMT	
volcstat_counts.ps - Postscript output file
volcstat_counts_<type>.out - for each event, the Julian date is written out, one file per subclass
volcstat_daily_<type>.out - number of events per day, files written for each subclass
volcstat_counts_total.out - total event counts for each subclass

Figure 46. Bar diagrams showing distribution of events of different subclasses over time.

RSAM

1-minute RSAM data can be created with WAVETOOL.

Future Extensions:
It is intended that additional parameters can be included in the above structure to included 
routine measurements of the volcanic earthquakes. For example, signal duration, peak amplitude 
and mean frequency can be calculated for individual stations and included on additional type 3 
lines with a volcanic identifier. Parameters on each channel can then be averaged an inserted 
on the volcanic header line.
